# CollabWatch
[CollabWatch](https://collabwatch.herokuapp.com/) is a website which allows you to watch class lectures with your friends or with randomised strangers.

## Problem 
One of the biggest problems with online learning is that there is not much human interation involved, which leads students to feel disconnected, isolated and like they are not part of a community. This results in them not watching lectures and also lowers grades and productivity. <br />
CollabWatch will help solve this problem by mimicking interactions you would have in an in-person class. CollabWatch does this by having a space where you can watch both live and video lectures with friends or with strangers.
