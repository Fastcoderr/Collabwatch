# CollabWatch
[CollabWatch](https://collabwatch.herokuapp.com/) is a website which allows you to watch class lectures with your friends or with randomised strangers.

## Problem 
One of the biggest problems with online learning is that there is not much human interation involved, which leads students to feel disconnected, isolated and like they are not part of a community. This results in them not watching lectures and also lowers grades and productivity. <br />
CollabWatch will help solve this problem by mimicking interactions you would have in an in-person class. CollabWatch does this by having a space where you can watch both live and video lectures with friends or with strangers. 

## Further Work
This project is not fully completed as we didnot  have the necessary permissions and the APIs to use our university's website and because of time constraints. <br />
The project in the porject will include:<br />
- Recorded and live lectures of the specific university which will be provided with the help of their APIs and permissions.
- Video calling for the people in the same "room". They will be able to socialise before and after lectures and will be able to ask doubts while in lecture. They will also be able to mute themselves and change speaker settings of the other peers.
- A doodle space for the people in the same room to explain ideas that they couldn't explain well enough verbally.
